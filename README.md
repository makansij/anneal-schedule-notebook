# Anneal Schedule

This notebook explains and demonstrates the global anneal scheduling features.
These features can improve solutions to a problem and provide insight into the
behaviour and dynamics of problems undergoing quantum annealing.

*anneal schedule* refers to the global annealing trajectory. It specifies the
normalized anneal fraction, ``s``, an abstract parameter ranging from 0 to 1.
``s(t)`` is a continuous function starting at ``s=0`` for time ``t=0``
and ending with ``s=1`` at ``t=t_f``, the total time of the anneal.

There are two ways to specify the anneal schedule, using two *mutually exclusive*
parameters:

1. ``annealing_time``: Set to a number in microseconds to specify linear growth
   from ``s=0`` to ``s=1`` over that time.
2. ``annealing_schedule``: Specify a list of ``(t, s)`` pairs specifying
   points, which are then linearly interpolated. This feature supports two
   modes&mdash;mid-anneal pause and mid-anneal quench&mdash;which this tutorial
   explores.

The notebook has the following sections:

1. **Understanding the Anneal Schedule** explains the feature.
2. **Using Anneal Schedule Features** shows how to use the feature with an
   interactive example problem.
3. **Mapping Various Anneal Schedules** provides code that sweeps through various
   anneal schedules to explore the effect on results.

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support 
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install 
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is 
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to 
[access Leap’s Solvers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your 
Leap account [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_leap_dev_env.html).  

The notebook can be opened by clicking on the 
``01-anneal-schedule.ipynb`` file in VS Code-based IDEs. 

To run a locally installed notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
